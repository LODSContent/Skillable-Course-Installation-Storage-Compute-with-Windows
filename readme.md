This repository is for collaboration, and constructive feedback so we may continually grow, improve, and provide a better experience to learners and trainers. 

Skillable Community Courses use our modern challenge-centric instructional design model.  This means the live hands-on labs are at the forefront of this course allowing learners to learn while doing and provides trainers with the flexibility to address demonstrate the “need to know” information based on a class audience’s profile.  Each Skillable Community Course includes access additional reference materials and post class access to Skillable’s Challenge Labs to further promote and enable continuous learning.
